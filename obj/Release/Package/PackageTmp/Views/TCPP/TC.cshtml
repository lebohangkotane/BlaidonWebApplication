    <h5>Informal Negotiations</h5>
    <p>
        To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a
        "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating
        arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party
    </p>

    <h5>Binding Arbitration</h5>
    <p>
        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial
        Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this

        contract shall be the substantive law of South Africa.
    </p>

        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is
        no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures, and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
    </p>

    <p>
        <div>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration:</div>
        <div>(a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;</div>

        <div>(c) any claim for injunctive relief.</div>

        <div>

            be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
